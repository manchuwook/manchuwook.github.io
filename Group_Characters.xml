					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="8" augmentedmaximum="12" minimum="2" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="0" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="0" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
					<traitcost bp="5"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Logic" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="0" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Intuition" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="6"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="0" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

						<description>Claws. Sharp, pointy teeth. A spiked tail. Whatever form it takes, the critter possesses some means of inflicting Physical damage. The description of this power describes the nature of the attack, as well as its Damage Value and Armor Penetration modifiers where applicable. Natural weapons may be either melee or ranged attacks, and critters follow standard combat rules when using them. Critters use the Unarmed Combat skill to attack with natural melee weapons, and the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill to attack with natural ranged weapons. Most natural weapons are considered normal weapons for purposes of the Immunity to Normal Weapons power; exceptions are noted in individual critter descriptions.

A dual-natured critter with a melee Natural Weapon can use this power against astral targets that are within its reach. Use the critter's normal Unarmed Combat skill and physical Damage Value for this attack. Ranged Natural Weapons, like other ranged combat, do not work on the astral plane. Critters without a Natural Weapon may still make an unarmed attack. As with regular characters, the Damage Value is (STR)S.</description>

				<description>5th born son of the Sine family, a prominent family of elven high mages, Celeus was an immediate dissapointment due to the fact he was born... human.  A dark family secret, Celeus (meaning: without elven nature), was kept away from the peers of the family.  He spent most of his life sequestered in the attic, where he read old books, and studied the world before through his limited astral travel.  He might have been a gifted mage if his family had fostered his skills.

Only his little sister would keep him company, frequenting his attic loft, and doing her best to tutor his raw and unfocused abilities.

Celeus suffers from deep bouts of depression.  In moments of high stress he is known to "shut down."  His sister says his brain sometimes breaks.

His magic is unfocused, raw, and amateur.

His family burned his SIN when he turned 18.  His mother, Galaneth, sent him to Houston with some money, and forbade him from returning.

For the last two years he has signed on to 12 amateur Shadow Runs.  He took on the melodramatic name "Argent Flame."  All 12 of his runs ended in failure, with all members of the team either dying, or being critically hospitalized.  Somehow, Argent Flame survived each, and did so unscathed.

This has given him a reputation among amateur Shadow Runners, since at the very least, he is now highly experienced.  Though no one can attest to how good he is, or how bad.  

He made a mistake early in his career by taking on a loan from Yakuze operatives to get his fake SIN and set up his connections.  He just can't seem to pay it back...</description>

				<attribute name="Initiate Grade" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="11" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>As Awakened characters grow in power, they often find that their initial explorations into magic and the astral plane can only take them so far in understanding and increasing their abilities. In order to increase their powers, magicians and adepts will often choose to undergo initiation in the mysteries of magic, the astral world, and the metaplanes in hope of increasing their connection with the Awakened world.

Initiation allows a character to wield greater magical abilities known as metamagic, access the metaplanes of astral space (p. 191), and raise her Magic attribute beyond her natural maximum of 6. Only characters with the Magician, Adept, or Mystic Adept qualities may initiate. Initiation is a serious process that requires a great deal of mental and spiritual preparation in the form of rituals or study appropriate to the character's tradition. A mage might spend months in research on a particular point of magic, writing a scholarly thesis in order to prepare, while a shaman might undergo a vision quest and seek guidance from her mentor spirit.

Initiation is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. At the end of a character's first initiation, she is a Grade 1 initiate. When she completes her second initiation, she is a Grade 2 initiate, and so on. The numerical system is for tracking initiation levels in game terms: each tradition refers to grades of initiation in their own way.

The cost to initiate is equal to 10 + (Grade x 3) in Karma points. Characters who wish to initiate must pay that cost in order to achieve their new grade.

A character's initiate grade cannot exceed her Magic attribute. If a character's Magic is reduced below her initiate grade, she loses that level of initiation and the metamagic she gained with it.</description>

â¢ Magicians can astrally project.

â¢ Magicians can choose freely from the magical skills or skill groups (Sorcery, Conjuring, Enchanting).

â¢ Magicians can cast spells, conjure spirits, or enchant magical items.

â¢ At character creation, magicians who cast spells, perform rituals, or create alchemical preparations may know a maximum number of formulae from each group equal to their Magic Rating x 2 (i.e., Magic Rating of 4 allows 8 spells, 8 rituals, 8 alchemical preparations).</description>

					<quality name="Lucky">
						<description>The dice roll and the coin flips this character's way more often than not, giving her the chance to drop jaws in amazement at her good fortune. Lucky allows a character to possess an Edge attribute one point higher than his metatype maximum (for example, a human character could raise her Edge to 8). Note that taking this quality does not actually increase the character's current Edge rating, it just allows her the opportunity to do so; the Karma cost for gaining the extra point must still be paid. This quality may only be taken once and must be approved by the gamemaster. The Lucky quality cannot be combined with Exceptional Attribute.</description>

					<quality name="Astral Beacon">
						<description>The astral signature of a character with the Astral Beacon quality is like, well, a beacon - highly visible on the astral plane. The signature also lasts twice as long as it would without the Astral Beacon quality and others assensing it receive a -1 to the threshold of their Assensing Test for gathering information about it. Only characters with a Magic rating may take this quality.</description>

					<quality name="Combat Paralysis">
						<description>A character with Combat Paralysis freezes in combat. On the character's first Initiative Test, the character divides their Initiative Score for that round in half (rounded up). In subsequent phases, the character may roll their normal Initiative. Combat Paralysis also gives the character a -3 dice pool modifier on Surprise Tests. If the character must make a Composure Test while under fire or in a similar combat situation, the gamemaster applies a +1 threshold modifier.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-12"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Dependent(s) (1): Junkie Ex-Girlfriend" rank="1">
						<description>A character with the Dependents quality has one or more loved ones who depend on them for emotional support and financial aid. Dependents may include children, parents, a spouse or lover, a sibling, or an old friend. Meeting the needs of a dependent should take up a fair amount of the character's time, as well as some of the character's money. Increase the amount of time it takes to learn a new skill or improve an existing skill by fifty percent. See the Character Advancement section on p. 103 for more information on how long it takes to improve skills. Also increase the base time for any long-term projects by fifty percent. A dependent could also be a hindrance in other ways - getting underfoot, sharing living space, involving herself in the character's work, borrowing the car, calling at the most inopportune moments, etc.

For 3 Karma, the dependent is an occasional nuisance: dropping in unexpectedly (such as when the character must go to a meet), needing emotional support, favors, or other confirmations of friendship/commitment, and occasionally money. Examples of dependents at this level include: slacker sibling, long-term boyfriend/girlfriend, or a child not living with the character but for whom the character pays child support and visits regularly. Raise the character's lifestyle cost by 10 percent each month.

For 6 Karma, the dependent is a regular inconvenience: needing attention and commitment on a regular basis, getting involved in the character's affairs, sharing living space. Examples of dependents at this level include: a live-in lover/wife/husband or family member, a child for whom the character shares custody and routinely has in his home (every other weekend, etc.), or a young child or close sibling for whom the character is responsible. Increase the character's lifestyle cost by 20 percent each month.

At the 9 Karma level, the dependent is close family or a life partner and lives with the character. The dependent is a strain on the character's time and resources, and/or requires special care and attention that limits the character's availability for missions or specific actions. Examples of these dependents include large family sharing the living space, parents or grandparents with medical or physical needs, and full custody of any children. Increase the lifestyle cost for the character by 30 percent each month.</description>

						<description>This spell creates a glowing field of magical energy around the subject that protects against Physical Damage. It provides Armor equal to the hits scored and is cumulative with other armor. It is not included in any calculations to determine armor encumbrance (see Armor and Encumbrance, p. 169).</description>

						<description>Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals a number of boxes of Physical damage equal to the spell's hits from the Spellcasting Test. Hits can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each hit spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn (you can split hits between healing and reducing time).

Any boxes of Physical damage your target still has after any boxes are healed magically can only be healed by time and rest.</description>

						<description>This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visible to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain undetected if she's good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject's surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.</description>

						<description>Death Touch, Manabolt, and Manaball all channel destructive magical power into the target, doing Physical damage. The damage inflicted is similar to massive cellular die off from radiation or necrotizing fasciitis, but without the continuing effects. But still, ick. Since they are mana spells, spells in this group only affect living and magical targets and are resisted with Willpower. Death Touch requires the magician to touch the target. Manabolt affects a single target, Manaball is an area-effect spell.</description>

					<spell name="Mindnet (limited)" casting="9" drain="8" draintext="F-2" drainvalue="-2" duration="Sustained" type="Mana" range="Touch" category="Detection" subcat="Active Detection Spell,Area,Psychic Detection Spell">
						<description>Mindnet is a variation of the Mindlink spell (p. 287, SR5) designed to allow telepathic communication between a group of voluntary people. Everyone in the group can freely talk, exchange images, and emote as long as they remain within range of the target of the spell (the person touched when the spell is cast). The number of people participating in the group (excluding the target) serves as the threshold for the Spellcasting Test. Once any participants have left the range of the spell, it must be recast for them to once again to gain the benefits of Mindnet, though the other participants may continue to participate in the link as long as they remain in range and the spell is sustained.

Mindnet is an area spell, while Mindlink Extended is an extended area spell.</description>

					<metamagic name="Greater Ritual">
						<description>Greater ritual allows the magician to participate in a ritual without adding dice to it. Instead, the magician amplifies the ritual by adding her Magic rating to the ritual's Force for determining its limit, size, and effect. This addition is not included in the completion step of the ritual (p. 296, SR5). The magician takes Drain as if she actively participated in the ritual. The magician can be the leader of the ritual and still use greater ritual metamagic, but this adds +2 to the Drain Value when the ritual completes.</description>

Cash for the late 21st century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person - the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorization to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed on the table. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it - so don't get excited when you see a gold credstick until you've slotted it and checked its balance.</description>

								<description>This commlink upgrade gives you the simsense experience, translating computer data into neural signals that allow you to directly experience simsense programs and augmented reality. A sim module must be accessed via a direct neural interface (trodes, datajack, or implanted commlink). Sim modules are a must-have for virtual reality of sorts, including VR clubs, VR games, simsense, and darker virtual pleasures. Sim modules can be modified for hot-sim, which opens up the full (and dangerous) range of VR experiences.</description>

						<description>When you cast a spell through a sustaining focus, it sustains the spell for you, letting you avoid the dice pool penalty for sustaining a spell. A spell sustained by a sustaining focus cannot have a Force greater than that of the focus, and the spell's category must match the focus's category. If a spell sustained by a focus is disrupted, it ends, but the focus is still active (and still bound to its owner), it's just not sustaining a spell at the moment. A sustaining focus can't be used to sustain a spell ritual.</description>

							<attribute name="Force" text="7" base="7" modified="7" naturalmaximum="99" augmentedmaximum="11" minimum="-1" category="Defining">
								<description>Spells, spirits, and magic items (foci) have an attribute known as Force. This measures the magical power of the object, spell, or being. Force is measured on the same scale as metahuman attributes (natural 1 to 6). For spells and foci, this is often their only attribute.</description>
								<traitcost bp="0"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Body" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="16" minimum="1" category="Physical">
								<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
								<traitcost bp="4"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Agility" text="10" base="10" modified="10" naturalmaximum="10" augmentedmaximum="29" minimum="1" category="Physical">
								<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
								<traitcost bp="6"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Reaction" text="11" base="11" modified="11" naturalmaximum="11" augmentedmaximum="31" minimum="1" category="Physical">
								<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
								<traitcost bp="6"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Strength" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="14" minimum="1" category="Physical">
								<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
								<traitcost bp="3"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Willpower" text="7" base="7" modified="7" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="21" minimum="1" category="Mental">
								<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
								<traitcost bp="6"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Logic" text="7" base="7" modified="7" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="21" minimum="1" category="Mental">
								<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>
								<traitcost bp="6"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Intuition" text="7" base="7" modified="7" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="21" minimum="1" category="Mental">
								<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
								<traitcost bp="6"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Charisma" text="7" base="7" modified="7" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="21" minimum="1" category="Mental">
								<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>
								<traitcost bp="6"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Essence" text="7" base="7" modified="7" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="21" minimum="1" category="Derived">
								<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

							<attribute name="Edge" text="4" base="4" modified="4" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="14" minimum="1" category="Special">
								<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

							<attribute name="Magic" text="7" base="7" modified="7" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="21" minimum="0" category="Heritage???Special">
								<description>If you intend to cast spells or use magic in any way, your character needs to have the Magic attribute. Most individuals do not have this attribute, meaning their rating is zero. Mages, who cast spells, and adepts, who channel magic into enhanced physical and mental abilities, need this quality. Their Magic rating measures how capable they are in the arcane arts and how much power they can draw down to help them in their efforts.</description>

									<description>This allows a critter to draw a target into itself or the terrain it controls, smothering or otherwise enveloping the target and causing damage. This is a melee attack. If it succeeds, it inflicts damage equal to its Magic x 2 (see below for specific effects by element), and the critter has engulfed its target in its grasp. Net hits on the melee attack increase this damage normally. The target gets a Damage Resistance Test as normal, using Body + Armor; the attack has an AP of - (critter's Magic).

Once engulfed, a target is trapped and cannot move.

Every time its Action Phase comes up after this, until the target escapes, the critter automatically inflicts damage as above; the target gets to resist each time as above. On the target's Action Phase, he may use a Complex Action to try to escape. To attempt escape, make an Opposed Test, rolling the target's Strength + Body against the critter's Magic + Body. If the target wins, she escapes and takes no more damage from the attack.

Some engulf powers have secondary effects; these are described here.

Air Engulf: The victim resists Stun as if from an inhalation- vector toxin attack (p. 408). Armor does not protect against this attack, but other protective gear might (Toxin and Drug Protection Table, p. 408). If the victim passes out from Stun damage, she continues to take damage, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal.

Earth Engulf: The target resists Physical damage.

Fire Engulf: The victim resists Fire damage (p. 171).

Water Engulf: The victim resists Stun damage. This is rougher than normal drowning, because the critter is capable of exerting great pressure on the victim. Victims who pass out from Stun damage continue to take damage after falling unconscious, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal.</description>

A critter with Immunity has an enhanced resistance to a certain type of attack or affliction. The critter gains an "Armor rating" equal to twice its Magic against that damage. This Immunity Armor is treated as "hardened" protection (see Hardened Armor above), meaning that if the Damage Value does not exceed the Armor, then the attack automatically does no damage.

					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="1.4" base="1" modified="1.4" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="5.4" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

					<quality name="Common Sense">
						<description>"Common sense is not so common" as they say. It's nothing supernatural, just a keen sense of knowing when something is just a bad idea. Any time a character with this quality is about to do something the gamemaster deems foolish, the gamemaster must act as their proverbial inner voice of reason and issue a little warning. The gamemaster can only give a number of warnings per session equal to or less than the character's Edge rating. After that, they're on their own.</description>

					<quality name="Profiler">
						<description>If you know someone well, you can often guess their actions. Simple enough in theory, and something that you have mastered. Given enough information about someone, you are able to get into their head and know what buttons to push and how to manipulate them. With an appropriate dossier on a person and one hour to study it, you gain a modifier to your dice pool and your Social Limit on all Social Tests involving that person, equal to the net hits on a Matrix Search test (maximum +3).

An appropriate dossier can be gathered via a Matrix Search test. The threshold is always at least 3, but depending on the individual may be as high as 6 (gamemaster's discretion). The information required is always Obscure (-2 modifier) and may be On Another Grid (further -2 modifier, gamemaster's discretion).

The downside to the character's ability to profile others so well is an inability to react smoothly when unprepared. The character suffers -1 to their Social Limit in any and all situations where they could not prepare.</description>

Selecting it at character creation allows the character to buy a piece of gear with an Availability of up to 24 (circumventing the normal Availability limit at character creation). After character creation, taking this quality lets the character purchase one piece of gear with an Availability up to 18 during play with just a single commcall.

					<quality name="Code of Honor: Bushido 2.0 (7dicepool vs. 4)">
						<description>Restriction: Must always follow the commands of one's superiors, no matter the personal cost.

As noted before, Bushido's rebirth swept across the corporate world, triggering an entire generation's adoption of the Bushido code into corporate life. Most of these neo-samurai are executives who've likely never held a weapon in their lives but whose status as lords in the feudal-corporate empire gives them sway over scores of lesser lights. Rewarding experienced security forces, or corporate soldiers, with a samurai status elevates them to the lowest rung of corporate nobility - still below the masters but a cut above the common worker. It's this class that holds to the new Bushido the tightest, expecting to see their loyalty ultimately rewarded with promotions and power. They follow the Way of the Samurai, but rather than focus on Meiyo, or honor, they hold Chugo, duty, to be the highest of the virtues.

These corporate samurai obey whatever order comes from above, no matter how shameful or dishonorable. One cannot put one's honor above one's better, and if they command you to toss someone out a window, cut down your cousin, or falsify records to implicate your best friend, you either obey or slit your stomach for an honorable escape.

Code of Honor
The character has a binding Code of Honor when it comes to killing members of a specific group; it's a matter of unwavering principle. The character with the Code of Honor quality chooses a specific group that they will not kill or allow others to kill. Examples of this group could include women, children, innocent bystanders, or a specific metatype. A character can choose to protect specific paracritters, but only if the specified paracritter possesses the Sapience power.

The gamemaster must approve the group that the character designates as being "off limits." If the group (such as children) is not regularly encountered in campaigns, the gamemaster can reject the choice. If the player feels strongly about his choice, the gamemaster may allow the player to take two groups they will not harm, (i.e., women and children), one of which must be likely to be encountered in the campaign. A magician can legitimately choose to not destroy any type of spirit from which their Mentor Spirit bestows a bonus for summoning. This Code of Honor respects their Mentor Spirit and is worthy of the Karma. Characters can't pick an obscure or non-existent group to acquire this quality - you can't acquire Karma by vowing to never kill sapient hamsters, for example.

Any time anyone attempts to kill a member of the character's protected list, the character must make a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test. A failed roll means the character must immediately put a stop the violence against the member of their protected group. If the situation forces the character to take action against any of his protected group, he will always choose non-lethal methods. Killing a member of the group he has sworn to protect is a line he will not cross for any reason.

There are drawbacks to having a Code of Honor. For example, it can leave witnesses behind. For each person in the protected group the character leaves alive and who is in a position to remember them, increase the character's Public Awareness by 1. The character's job options are also limited - he will not take a job if the objective is the death of a member of his protected group and will have reservations about taking part in a mission with a high probability of causing collateral harm to members of his protected group.

There is always a chance things will go wrong whenever non-lethal force is used. A person may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a usually harmless knockout drug, or a heart condition that makes a taser shock deadly. For this reason, each time the character takes a violent action or allows others to take violent action against a member of his chosen group, the gamemaster makes a secret roll of 1D6. On a roll of 1, there is an unforeseen complication from the use of non-lethal force. With a metahuman it could be a life-threatening medical condition; with a spirit, an attempt to banish rather than destroy may in fact set the spirit free. When a complication arises, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception (4) Test for the character to notice if anything has gone wrong.

If a person in the character's chosen group is killed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, the character loses a point of Karma for that adventure for each person in their "protected group" that is killed.

The Code of Honor can take other forms as well. For example:
â¢ Assassin's Creed: A character never kills anyone that they are not paid to kill. Being precise as an assassin, not leaving collateral damage, and being invisible are important hallmarks of those who believe in the Assassin's Creed. Characters who take this version of Code of Honor lose 1 point of Karma for every unintentional and/or unpaid murder th</description>

					<quality name="Creature of Comfort (Middle Lifestyle)" rank="1">
						<description>For the character with this quality, the rewards of a job well done are the finer things in life. Unfortunately, one can quickly get attached to the comforts one has acquired, making the fall seem ever so higher. At the 10 Karma level, the character is used to a Middle Lifestyle, at the 17 level a High, and 25, it's Luxury all the way, baby.

For every day that the character must spend "slumming" it in a lower Lifestyle category, the irritable character suffers a -1 penalty to all Social and Healing tests per Lifestyle category below his chosen level. For example, if the character takes this Quality at the High Lifestyle level and is forced to stay in a Squatter Lifestyle, he will suffer -3 to all Social and Healing tests. Life just isn't worth living without Cognac.</description>

This allows the user to hear sounds outside the normal range, such as dog whistles or ultrasound- based motion detectors, which would otherwise go unnoticed. If combined with a device to create such sounds, such as a voice modulator, then a method of signaling, or even communication, can be employed that is difficult for those without the augmentation to listen in on.</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

								<description>With this modification, most of the weapon's moving parts are removed so that it can fire electronically, meaning that an electrical signal detonates the bullet's propellant. This provides 1 point of recoil compensation and a -1 dice pool modifier to sound-based Perception Tests when trying to locate where the weapon is being fired from. Electronic firing is usually combined with trigger removal (see p. 182) to further reduce the number of moving parts, but this is not mandatory. The weapon still includes a loading mechanism that moves the bullet into the chamber, and it requires caseless ammunition.</description>

Frangible bullets can put some hurt on a metahuman target, but they break up when hitting something hard, meaning they won't damage nearby metal-encased gear. Or armored-up trolls, so select it with caution.

When an item is Custom Fit, any changes to an individual's Physical Attributes, whether through Karma advancement or augmentation (but not through magic), require the suit to be refit.

					<item name="Synthskin Face Mask" rating="6" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>With the popular nanopaste disguise kit falling in popularity due to CFD concerns, the synthskin facemask has taken its market share. It is composed of a programmable electropolymer commonly used in the skin covering of synthetic cyberware and humanoid mimic drones. It produces a lifelike replica of an individual's face. A person's face can be duplicated if you have a scan from a biometric reader (with the dice bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the biometric reader's Rating). A Software + Logic Test (with the dice bonus on the Disguise Test equal to the successes) can replicate a specific individual's face or create a completely unique appearance. In either case, the limit on the test is equal to the Rating of the mask. The mask is reusable in the sense that it can be worn multiple times, but once an appearance has been set in either fashion described above, it cannot be altered.</description>

						<description>Building and repairing items requires the right tools for the job. Tools must be bought separately for a specific skill (for example, an Armorer shop, a Disguise kit, a Nautical Mechanic facility, etc.). A kit is portable and contains the basic gear to make standard repairs.

Notes on Hand Loads
In spite of the changes in the manufacturing of bullets over the last half century making the process more complex, there are still a few individuals who prefer to load their own ammo. Hand load ammo can be crafted to add a +1 Damage Value modifier or an additional -1 AP (but not both). Crafting this ammo requires an Armorer Extended Test to craft 10 rounds of ammunition with a Threshold and Duration as specified in the table below. This test requires a Hand Loading tool kit and crafting materials costing the standard value of the type of ammo being made plus ten percent.

Type: Threshold (Duration)
Regular firearms ammo: 4 (30 minutes)
Special firearms ammo: 6 (30 minutes)
Regular heavy weapon ammo: 8 (1 hour)
Special heavy weapon ammo: 10 (1 hour)</description>

				<attribute name="Body" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="5/7" base="5" modified="7" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="5" base="5" modified="5" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Logic" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Intuition" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

Their Magic rating measures how capable they are in the arcane arts and how much power they can draw down to help them in their efforts.</description>

					<quality name="High Pain Tolerance (1)" rank="1">
						<description>High Pain Tolerance lets a character keep delivering the pain even if she's had plenty piled on her own head. A character with High Pain Tolerance can ignore one box of damage per rating point of this quality when calculating wound modifiers (see Wound Modifiers, p. 169). So a character with this quality at Rating 2 can take 4 boxes of damage but carry on without wound modifiers as if she only had 2 boxes of damage. The -1 wound modifier would then kick in when the character takes her fifth box in damage. This quality may not be used with the Pain Resistance adept power, pain editor bioware, or damage compensator bioware.</description>

					<quality name="Code of Honor: Warrior's Code (6dicepool vs. 4)">
						<description>â¢ Warrior's Code: The character who follows a Warrior's Code maintains a strict sense of personal honor. In 2075, this likely means a character will not kill an unarmed person, take lethal action against an opponent who is unaware or unprepared for an attack (i.e., a guard who doesn't know the runner is there), or knowingly take an action that could kill someone who is defenseless (i.e., from a stray bullet or allow someone to be killed from a sniper shot). The character loses 1 Karma per unarmed or defenseless person that they kill or allow to be killed through their actions.

Code of Honor
The character has a binding Code of Honor when it comes to killing members of a specific group; it's a matter of unwavering principle. The character with the Code of Honor quality chooses a specific group that they will not kill or allow others to kill. Examples of this group could include women, children, innocent bystanders, or a specific metatype. A character can choose to protect specific paracritters, but only if the specified paracritter possesses the Sapience power.

The gamemaster must approve the group that the character designates as being "off limits." If the group (such as children) is not regularly encountered in campaigns, the gamemaster can reject the choice. If the player feels strongly about his choice, the gamemaster may allow the player to take two groups they will not harm, (i.e., women and children), one of which must be likely to be encountered in the campaign. A magician can legitimately choose to not destroy any type of spirit from which their Mentor Spirit bestows a bonus for summoning. This Code of Honor respects their Mentor Spirit and is worthy of the Karma. Characters can't pick an obscure or non-existent group to acquire this quality - you can't acquire Karma by vowing to never kill sapient hamsters, for example.

Any time anyone attempts to kill a member of the character's protected list, the character must make a Charisma + Willpower (4) Test. A failed roll means the character must immediately put a stop the violence against the member of their protected group. If the situation forces the character to take action against any of his protected group, he will always choose non-lethal methods. Killing a member of the group he has sworn to protect is a line he will not cross for any reason.

There are drawbacks to having a Code of Honor. For example, it can leave witnesses behind. For each person in the protected group the character leaves alive and who is in a position to remember them, increase the character's Public Awareness by 1. The character's job options are also limited - he will not take a job if the objective is the death of a member of his protected group and will have reservations about taking part in a mission with a high probability of causing collateral harm to members of his protected group.

There is always a chance things will go wrong whenever non-lethal force is used. A person may have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a usually harmless knockout drug, or a heart condition that makes a taser shock deadly. For this reason, each time the character takes a violent action or allows others to take violent action against a member of his chosen group, the gamemaster makes a secret roll of 1D6. On a roll of 1, there is an unforeseen complication from the use of non-lethal force. With a metahuman it could be a life-threatening medical condition; with a spirit, an attempt to banish rather than destroy may in fact set the spirit free. When a complication arises, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception (4) Test for the character to notice if anything has gone wrong.

If a person in the character's chosen group is killed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, the character loses a point of Karma for that adventure for each person in their "protected group" that is killed.</description>

					<quality name="Distinctive Style: Samurai">
						<description>A character with the Distinctive Style quality has at least one aspect of his appearance, mannerism, or personality that makes him inconveniently memorable. Choices for Distinctive Style include, but are by no means limited to: tattoos that cannot be easily concealed, an accent or atypical manner of speaking, bizarre fashion choices, scars, gang or prison signs, flashy custom augmentations, or non-metahuman modifications like a tail. Note that what's distinctive in one culture or location may not be in another.

Whatever Distinctive Style the player selects makes her character easy to remember. Anyone who attempts to identify, trace, or physically locate this character (or gain information about him via legwork) receives a +2 dice pool modifier for relevant tests. If an NPC makes a Memory Test (p. 152) to determine how much they recall about the character, reduce the Difficulty Threshold by 1, to a minimum of 1.

This quality is physical in nature and does not apply to astral searches. This quality may only be taken once. This quality is incompatible with Blandness.</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="SINner (National SIN): Japan">
						<description>There are four types of SINs that fall under the SINner (Layered) quality: National SIN, Criminal SIN (either Corporate or National), Corporate Limited SIN, or Corporate Born. Individuals with SINs are required by law to always broadcast their SINs. A legal SIN is required for all legal purchases. This makes them very useful things to have, so those who are SINless generally get by with the use of fake SINs (p. 367) just so they can participate in society.

National SIN At the 5 Karma level, the character has what is called a National SIN. The character's parents were legal citizens of a nation (such as the UCAS or CAS) and he has been a citizen of that nation from birth. He has the right to vote, qualify for passports issued by his nation, enlist in the national military, or work in the national government. A National SIN is required for any national security clearance or any form of national military career. A character with a National SIN pays fifteen percent of their gross income in taxes. He is also in no way connected to any of the megacorporations. The main drawback to having a legal National SIN is the character is in the system. The nation in the player character's background has the character's biometric data (DNA, fingerprints, retinal scans) on file, and that biometric data is shared with law enforcement agencies through the Global SIN Registry. This makes it much easier to track a character should a job go sideways. Also, nations typically sell the personal information tied to the character's SIN to corporations. Those with a legal SIN get nearly three times as much spam as those who don't have a SIN or rely on fake SINs, and the spam messages they receive are disturbingly tailored to their preferences (based on their buying and browsing habits).</description>

						<description>The subject can detect living targets within range who have hostile intentions toward him.

						<description>This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visible to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain undetected if she's good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject's surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.</description>

						<description>You call upon inner strength to perform amazing physical feats beyond their normal abilities. Attribute Boost must be purchased for a specific Physical Attribute (Agility, Body, Reaction, or Strength); separate Attribute Boost powers may be bought for different attributes. This power cannot be purchased for a Mental or Special Attribute.

When you activate this power, make a Magic + Attribute Boost Rating Test. Each hit on this test boosts your attribute rating by 1, up to your augmented Attribute maximum. This only affects your dice pools; your Physical limit and Initiative ratings don't change with Attribute Boost. The boost lasts for a number of Combat Turns equal to twice the number of hits you get. When the boost runs out, you take Drain equal to the level of this power.</description>

A weapon focus is effective against astral forms too, whether you're using astral perception or projection. It adds its Force to your Astral Combat Tests when you're using it, and you can take it along while astrally projecting.

						<description>Building and repairing items requires the right tools for the job. Tools must be bought separately for a specific skill (for example, an Armorer shop, a Disguise kit, a Nautical Mechanic facility, etc.). A facility needs a building and is immobile because of the bulky and heavy machines involved, but it can be used for very advanced constructions and modifications. Shops and facilities are both stocked with standard spare parts.

There are some guidelines to help you figure out when a kit, shop, or facility is necessary for a particular job (Building &amp; Repairing, p. 145). The gamemaster gets final say, though, and might even tell you that you need specific or unusual parts you have to get separately.</description>

Commlinks are universal communication devices; they're used by everyone all the time. Commlinks are essentially the digital Swiss army knives of the modern world. Even the most basic of them includes AR Matrix browsing capability, multiple telephone and radio modes of real-time talk and text, music players, micro trid-projectors, touchscreen displays, built in high-resolution digital video and still image cameras, image/text and RFID tag scanners, built-in GPS guidance systems, chip players, credstick readers, retractable earbuds, voice-access dialing, text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies, and a shock and water resistant case. And all of this at an inexpensive price that a few decades ago would have seemed absurd.</description>

				<attribute name="Body" text="10" base="10" modified="10" naturalmaximum="10" augmentedmaximum="14" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
					<traitcost bp="5"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Agility" text="4/6" base="4" modified="6" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="8" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
					<traitcost bp="3"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Reaction" text="5/6" base="5" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="9" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Strength" text="9/11" base="9" modified="11" naturalmaximum="10" augmentedmaximum="13" minimum="1" category="Physical">
					<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
					<traitcost bp="4"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Willpower" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Logic" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="7" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>
					<traitcost bp="2"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Intuition" text="2" base="2" modified="2" naturalmaximum="5" augmentedmaximum="6" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
					<traitcost bp="0 +&#xA;10K"/>
				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Charisma" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="4" augmentedmaximum="5" minimum="1" category="Mental">
					<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				</attribute>
				<attribute name="Essence" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="5" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Edge" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="1" category="Special">
					<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

					<quality name="Born Rich">
						<description>Richie Rich has fallen into the shadows. The character came from an affluent background (e.g., high-level corporate kid, old-money family, Mafia princess, lottery winner), but is not necessarily still wealthy or doesn't have access to this additional wealth. During character creation, characters can normally gain extra resources at a rate of 2,000 nuyen per Karma point, up to 10 Karma maximum (p. 94, SR5). With this quality, available only during character creation, characters may exceed the usual 10 Karma limit and instead trade up to 40 Karma total at the same exchange rate of 2,000 nuyen per Karma point, for up to 80,000 nuyen of additional funds.</description>

				</positive>
				<negative>
					<quality name="Creature of Comfort (Middle Lifestyle)" rank="1">
						<description>For the character with this quality, the rewards of a job well done are the finer things in life. Unfortunately, one can quickly get attached to the comforts one has acquired, making the fall seem ever so higher. At the 10 Karma level, the character is used to a Middle Lifestyle, at the 17 level a High, and 25, it's Luxury all the way, baby.

For every day that the character must spend "slumming" it in a lower Lifestyle category, the irritable character suffers a -1 penalty to all Social and Healing tests per Lifestyle category below his chosen level. For example, if the character takes this Quality at the High Lifestyle level and is forced to stay in a Squatter Lifestyle, he will suffer -3 to all Social and Healing tests. Life just isn't worth living without Cognac.</description>

					<quality name="Did You Just Call Me Dumb?">
						<description>The character can't resist camouflaging insults into well-spoken words. The character gets the satisfaction of feeling superior to everyone. Unfortunately, once in a while people will notice and get pretty upset. Any Glitch rolled by this character on any Social test always counts as a Critical Glitch.</description>

					</quality>
					<quality name="Quasimodo">
						<description>The Sixth World is full of things that endanger normal genome expression, including Awakened dangers, environmental pollution, unpredictable mutagenics, and secret experimentation. People with this quality are the extreme result of such genetic tampering, whether hereditary or accidental. Characters with this quality suffer an unexpected genetic disorder that manifests as ugly and visceral physical deformities. The character suffers a -3 dice pool modifier on all Social Skill Tests not done via the Matrix and a +2 dice pool modifier for all Intimidation Tests. The character and gamemaster should negotiate to decide on an effect that is suitably negative. Quasimodo characters might also have developed personality quirks or aggressive behavior from years of social rejection.</description>

					<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others.

Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

The description of this power describes the nature of the attack, as well as its Damage Value and Armor Penetration modifiers where applicable. Natural weapons may be either melee or ranged attacks, and critters follow standard combat rules when using them. Critters use the Unarmed Combat skill to attack with natural melee weapons, and the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill to attack with natural ranged weapons. Most natural weapons are considered normal weapons for purposes of the Immunity to Normal Weapons power; exceptions are noted in individual critter descriptions.

A dual-natured critter with a melee Natural Weapon can use this power against astral targets that are within its reach. Use the critter's normal Unarmed Combat skill and physical Damage Value for this attack. Ranged Natural Weapons, like other ranged combat, do not work on the astral plane. Critters without a Natural Weapon may still make an unarmed attack. As with regular characters, the Damage Value is (STR)S.</description>

				<attribute name="Initiate Grade" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="11" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>As Awakened characters grow in power, they often find that their initial explorations into magic and the astral plane can only take them so far in understanding and increasing their abilities. In order to increase their powers, magicians and adepts will often choose to undergo initiation in the mysteries of magic, the astral world, and the metaplanes in hope of increasing their connection with the Awakened world.

Initiation allows a character to wield greater magical abilities known as metamagic, access the metaplanes of astral space (p. 191), and raise her Magic attribute beyond her natural maximum of 6. Only characters with the Magician, Adept, or Mystic Adept qualities may initiate. Initiation is a serious process that requires a great deal of mental and spiritual preparation in the form of rituals or study appropriate to the character's tradition. A mage might spend months in research on a particular point of magic, writing a scholarly thesis in order to prepare, while a shaman might undergo a vision quest and seek guidance from her mentor spirit.

Initiation is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. At the end of a character's first initiation, she is a Grade 1 initiate. When she completes her second initiation, she is a Grade 2 initiate, and so on. The numerical system is for tracking initiation levels in game terms: each tradition refers to grades of initiation in their own way.

The cost to initiate is equal to 10 + (Grade x 3) in Karma points. Characters who wish to initiate must pay that cost in order to achieve their new grade.

A character's initiate grade cannot exceed her Magic attribute. If a character's Magic is reduced below her initiate grade, she loses that level of initiation and the metamagic she gained with it.</description>

						<description>A technomancer or magic user with the Focused Concentration quality has the discipline to manipulate mana or Resonance more precisely than otherwise possible. This precision reduces stress to the magic user's or technomancer's body. She is able to sustain one spell/complex form with a force/level equal to her Focused Concentration rating without suffering any penalties. For example, a magic user with Focused Concentration rating 3 may sustain a Force 3 Armor spell without taking the negative dice pool modifier for sustaining a spell. Sustaining any additional spells or complex forms incurs the standard -2 dice pool modifier per spell or complex form sustained. This quality may only be taken by magic user characters that are able to cast spells and technomancers.</description>

					<quality name="Mentor Spirit: Thunderbird">
						<description>Everyone needs some help in life, even if it comes from someone relatively filmy and insubstantial. Mentor Spirit means the character follows a patron spirit (see Mentor Spirits, p. 320) that guides him in his practice of magic and provides certain advantages and disadvantages to his natural abilities. A character may change mentor spirits, but he may have only one mentor spirit at a time. To change mentor spirits, the character must first buy off the current mentor spirit as if it were a Negative quality. He can then purchase the quality again to follow a different mentor spirit. This cost represents the toll of divorcing from one mentor spirit and bonding with a new one.

Each tradition has a different name for a mentor spirit. Hermetic mages prefer the term "mentor spirit," while shamans use the word "totem" for the spirit that they follow. While the names may vary, the way the mentor works is consistent.

This quality is only available to characters that possess a Magic attribute rating.</description>
						<traitcost bp="5"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Spirit Affinity: Spirits of Air">
						<description>Available only to magic users, the Spirit Affinity quality allows a character to be attuned to one type of spirit (see Spirits, p. 303). These spirits find the character interesting, are drawn to her, and are more inclined to assist her. They may be reluctant to attack the character, and if forced to do so they are likely to use nonlethal power. Watchers and minions do not count for this quality as they are constructed and are not summoned like normal spirits. Spirit Affinity provides magicians with 1 additional spirit service for each spirit of that type, and it also provides a +1 dice pool modifier for Binding Tests.

Magic users may possess this quality for a type of spirit that is not part of their magical tradition.</description>

					<quality name="Emotional Attachment: Ballistic Mask (Customized)">
						<description>The character has an irrational emotional attachment to a piece of gear. The character will always use this item, even if presented with a "better" option. Furthermore, if lost in some manner, the character will do everything in his power, up to and including risking his life and that of his teammates, to retrieve his item. If the piece of gear is irretrievably lost or damaged, the player must either immediately spend Karma to buy off the quality or suffer a -1 penalty on all tests that would have used that piece of gear for a six-month period. After that time, they learn to love a replacement piece of gear, and the quality transfers to that item.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-5"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Faceless">
						<description>You have worn disguises so frequently and for so long that being out in public wearing your real face makes you feel vulnerable. You suffer a -2 dice pool modifier on Social tests unless your face is disguised or otherwise concealed. It does not matter if this disguise is magical or mundane, just that you are unrecognizable. People you know and trust such as close friends, family, or teammates do not require a disguise to avoid the penalty.</description>
						<traitcost bp="-6"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Prejudiced (Biased): Orks" rank="1">
						<description>With this quality the character is Prejudiced against members of a specific group of people: metahumans, Awakened, non-metahuman sapient critters, or some other group. The character is not merely intolerant - he is outspoken about his beliefs and may actively work against the target of his prejudice. Depending upon the degree of prejudice, this quality can get the character into trouble for expressing his views or when forced to confront the targets of his prejudice.

The Karma bonus granted by this quality varies depending upon how common the hated group is, how often the character is likely to encounter members of the group, and the degree to which the character is openly antagonistic toward them. Refer to the Prejudiced Table to determine the Karma value of the quality based on the prevalence of the hated group and the degree of prejudice.

When dealing with the target of their prejudice, a character receives a -2 dice pool modifier per level of severity of the Prejudiced quality for all Social Tests. If negotiations are a part of the encounter, the target receives a +2 modifier per level of the Prejudiced quality. So if a character who is radical in their prejudiced views against the Awakened tries to negotiate with the target of their prejudice, they receive a -6 to their Negotiation Test while the target receives a +6 dice pool modifier.

Prevalence of target group: Karma Value
Common target group (e.g, humans, metahumans): 5 Karma
Specific target group (e.g, the Awakened, technomancers, shapeshifters, aspected magicians): 3 Karma

Degree: Karma Value
Biased (e.g, closet meta-hater): 0 Karma
Outspoken (e.g, typical member of Humanis): 2 Karma
Radical (e.g, racial supremacist): 5 Karma</description>
						<traitcost bp="-5"/>
					</quality>
					<quality name="Social Stress: Being without his mask">
						<description>Whether as a result of loss or trauma or due to innate psychological makeup, the Social Stress quality burdens the character with emotions that interfere with his ability to interact with others. A specific cause and trigger for the Social Stress must be established. For example, if his Social Stress is caused by survivor's guilt after the loss of a close friend, unexpectedly encountering someone who looks similar to the lost friend will heighten stress. When a character is using Leadership or Etiquette skills, reduce the number of 1s required to glitch the test by 1. Gamemasters should call for more Social Tests for characters with Social Stress to determine how a character reacts to others, particularly if a situation related to the cause of their stress arises.</description>

						<description>This spell creates a glowing field of magical energy around the subject that protects against Physical Damage.

					<spell name="Confusion" casting="12" drain="8" draintext="F-3" drainvalue="-3" duration="Sustained" type="Mana" range="Line-of-Sight" category="Illusion" subcat="Full-Sensory Illusion Spell,Realistic Illusion Spell">
						<description>These spells produce a storm of conflicting sensations and images to confuse the senses. For each net hit on the Spellcasting Test, the target suffers a -1 dice pool modifier to all tests due to the distraction.

Confusion affects a single target. Mass Confusion is an area spell. The Chaos spell is a physical version of Confusion (above), so it also affects technological systems and sensing devices. Chaotic World is an area version of Chaos.</description>

					<spell name="Heal (limited)" casting="12" drain="8" draintext="F-6" drainvalue="-6" duration="Permanent" type="Mana" range="Touch" category="Health" subcat="Essence-Dependant Health Spell">
						<description>Heal repairs physical injuries. It heals a number of boxes of Physical damage equal to the spell's hits from the Spellcasting Test. Hits can also be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent; each hit spent this way shaves off 1 Combat Turn (you can split hits between healing and reducing time).

Any boxes of Physical damage your target still has after any boxes are healed magically can only be healed by time and rest.</description>

						<description>This spell makes the subject more difficult to detect by normal visual senses (including low-light, thermographic, and other senses that rely on the visual spectrum). The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses (hearing, smell, touch, and even taste, if it somehow comes to that). Her aura is still visible to astral perception.

Anyone who might be in a position to perceive the subject must first successfully resist the spell. Simply make one Spellcasting Test and use the hits scored as the threshold for anyone that resists at a later point. Even if the spell is resisted, the subject might remain undetected if she's good enough with her Sneaking Test. An invisible character may still be detected by non-visual means, such as hearing or smell. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the subject of the spell.

Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved Invisibility mimics the subject's surroundings from all angles and affects technological sensors as well.</description>

A version of this spell exists for each Physical and Mental attribute, but not for Special Attributes (Initiative, Edge, Essence, Magic, or Resonance). The Force of the spell must equal or exceed the (augmented) value of the Attribute being affected. The Attribute is increased by an amount equal to the hits scored, up to the target's augmented maximum (any hits that would increase the Attribute beyond its augmented maximum are ignored). Each Attribute can only be affected by a single Increase Attribute spell at a time.

Note that increasing an Attribute may affect other derived statistics (Increase Reaction also affects Initiative, for example, while Increase Body adds extra boxes to the character's Physical Condition Monitor for as long as the spell lasts).</description>

						<description>Greater ritual allows the magician to participate in a ritual without adding dice to it. Instead, the magician amplifies the ritual by adding her Magic rating to the ritual's Force for determining its limit, size, and effect. This addition is not included in the completion step of the ritual (p. 296, SR5). The magician takes Drain as if she actively participated in the ritual. The magician can be the leader of the ritual and still use greater ritual metamagic, but this adds +2 to the Drain Value when the ritual completes.</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

					<item name="Certified Credstick, Silver" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>Max Value: 20,000Â¥
Cash for the late 21st century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person - the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorization to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed on the table. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it - so don't get excited when you see a gold credstick until you've slotted it and checked its balance.</description>

						<description>An alchemist can create a magical device that reduces Drain when cast with a spell suited to fetishes (p. 212, SG). Such spells have to be learned specifically with the fetish, meaning that a character would have to learn a spell twice if he wants to cast it both with and without a fetish. An alchemist needs 1 dram of radical reagents to make the fetish functional for magical use. A magician casting a fetish spell either through Spellcasting or Ritual Spellcasting can reduce the Drain Value by 2 (to a minimum of 2).

					<item name="Improved Reflexes" rating="4" quantity="1">
						<description>Designing a focus requires a complex arcane recipe known as a focus formula. Focus formulae, like all magical formulae, are produced using the Arcana skill. They are too complex for metahuman magicians to memorize and must be recorded in some fashion. You can buy focus formulae from lore stores and talismongers.

All focus formulae specify the type of focus (spell, spirit, power, weapon, etc.), Force, form (wooden quarterstaff, gold ring, vibroknife, etc.), and tradition of the focus (hermetic, shamanic, etc.). The formulae sold by talismongers typically use "traditional" forms in widespread magical traditions (wands, magical amulets, rune-carved swords, etc.) - which is why a lot of magicians commonly create their own formulae. The focus formula must be for a Force that is equal to or less than your Magic rating - you cannot make foci with ratings greater than your Magic rating.

If you'd rather create your own focus formula, you can design one from scratch. Researching a focus formula is an Arcana + Magic [Astral] (Force x Force, 1 day) Extended Test. Once complete, the focus formula may be used by any magician of your tradition to make that specific focus. A magician can translate a focus formula from another tradition into their own with an Arcana + Magic [Astral] (Force, 1 day) Extended Test.</description>

					<item name="Magical Lodge Materials" rating="4" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>A magical lodge is a stationary collection of symbols, writings, tools, fetishes, and other mystical materials that helps spellcasters record their lore, expand their talent, and practice magic. It's a basic tool of magicians across the world, about the size of a room. You need it to learn spells, perform rituals, craft foci, and in a pinch you can use it to protect yourself from magical threats. Each lodge is of a specific tradition - a shamanic lodge is intended for shamans, and a hermetic lodge for mages.

Magical lodges don't always look like lodges per se. A shamanic lodge is a traditional medicine lodge, but a hermetic magician's lodge is a series of magic circles, shelves filled with arcane tomes, mystical mechanisms, and alchemical apparatuses. Every tradition has its own version of a magical lodge, but they all work the same way.

Magical lodges aren't intended to be portable (although you can make a temporary one with reagents, p. 316). To create your own, you need magical lodge materials (they cost Force x 500 nuyen) that are appropriate to your tradition. Once you have the materials, find a space to put it, like your apartment, or a cave in the wilderness, or a secret abandoned sewer tunnel - someplace you won't mind spending some time. Then spend a number of days equal to the lodge's Force dedicating the space, setting up the physical components, building its astral form, setting up barriers, and harmonizing it to your aura. Once you're done, your magical lodge is up and active. An active magical lodge acts as a mana barrier (p. 315) and shares your astral signature.

If you want to move your lodge, you'll need a day to take it down, turning it back into magical lodge materials; then you can set it up again somewhere else. If you want to improve your lodge, just bring in more materials to add to the current ones and spend a day times the Force you want the lodge to have at the end of your work.</description>

								<description>Spells, spirits, and magic items (foci) have an attribute known as Force. This measures the magical power of the object, spell, or being. Force is measured on the same scale as metahuman attributes (natural 1 to 6). For spells and foci, this is often their only attribute.</description>

								<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>

							<attribute name="Agility" text="9" base="9" modified="9" naturalmaximum="9" augmentedmaximum="26" minimum="1" category="Physical">
								<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>

							<attribute name="Reaction" text="10" base="10" modified="10" naturalmaximum="10" augmentedmaximum="29" minimum="1" category="Physical">
								<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
								<traitcost bp="5"/>

							<attribute name="Strength" text="3" base="3" modified="3" naturalmaximum="3" augmentedmaximum="11" minimum="1" category="Physical">
								<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>

								<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

							<attribute name="Intuition" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="19" minimum="1" category="Mental">
								<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>

							<attribute name="Charisma" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="19" minimum="1" category="Mental">
								<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="19" minimum="1" category="Derived">
								<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

								<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

								<description>If you intend to cast spells or use magic in any way, your character needs to have the Magic attribute. Most individuals do not have this attribute, meaning their rating is zero. Mages, who cast spells, and adepts, who channel magic into enhanced physical and mental abilities, need this quality. Their Magic rating measures how capable they are in the arcane arts and how much power they can draw down to help them in their efforts.</description>

									<description>This allows a critter to draw a target into itself or the terrain it controls, smothering or otherwise enveloping the target and causing damage. This is a melee attack. If it succeeds, it inflicts damage equal to its Magic x 2 (see below for specific effects by element), and the critter has engulfed its target in its grasp. Net hits on the melee attack increase this damage normally. The target gets a Damage Resistance Test as normal, using Body + Armor; the attack has an AP of - (critter's Magic).

Once engulfed, a target is trapped and cannot move.

Every time its Action Phase comes up after this, until the target escapes, the critter automatically inflicts damage as above; the target gets to resist each time as above. On the target's Action Phase, he may use a Complex Action to try to escape. To attempt escape, make an Opposed Test, rolling the target's Strength + Body against the critter's Magic + Body. If the target wins, she escapes and takes no more damage from the attack.

Some engulf powers have secondary effects; these are described here.

Air Engulf: The victim resists Stun as if from an inhalation- vector toxin attack (p. 408). Armor does not protect against this attack, but other protective gear might (Toxin and Drug Protection Table, p. 408). If the victim passes out from Stun damage, she continues to take damage, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal.

Earth Engulf: The target resists Physical damage.

Fire Engulf: The victim resists Fire damage (p. 171).

Water Engulf: The victim resists Stun damage. This is rougher than normal drowning, because the critter is capable of exerting great pressure on the victim. Victims who pass out from Stun damage continue to take damage after falling unconscious, with the Stun damage overflowing into Physical damage as normal.</description>

A critter with Immunity has an enhanced resistance to a certain type of attack or affliction. The critter gains an "Armor rating" equal to twice its Magic against that damage. This Immunity Armor is treated as "hardened" protection (see Hardened Armor above), meaning that if the Damage Value does not exceed the Armor, then the attack automatically does no damage.

Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

				<attribute name="Essence" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="12" augmentedmaximum="10" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

				<attribute name="Submersion Grade" text="1" base="1" modified="1" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="11" minimum="0" category="Derived">
					<description>Submersion strengthens the link between the technomancer and the Resonance. Similar to an Awakened character's initiation, submersion is a very personalized and ego-wrenching experience, a process of growth and awareness, a chance for the technomancer to better attune himself to the machine world. Submersion grants the technomancer greater abilities known as echoes, grants access to the mysterious Resonance realms hidden within the Matrix, and allows him to raise his Resonance attribute beyond its natural maximum of 6.

Submersion is measured in grades, beginning with Grade 1 and increasing. Submersion has a Karma cost equal to 10 + (Grade x 3). A technomancer's grade cannot exceed his Resonance attribute; if Resonance is ever reduced below the submersion grade, that level of submersion is lost.</description>

						<description>An incessant code tinkerer, you know very effective ways to hide your icon, making it look like nothing more than a piece of errant code. You gain +2 dice when resisting a Matrix Perception test while running silent. Unfortunately, whatever it is you're doing to hide yourself has one little flawâsprites, those mysterious creatures of the Matrix, can spot you instantly, exactly as if you weren't running silent at all.</description>

A little localized reset saves your bacon. Just like that. What are the odds, neh? Maybe GOD is on your side? That can't beâyou must just be that good.

As a Free Action, the character can spend 1 point of Edge to remove all marks a single opponent has on him. Note that in cases where other targets were sharing marks with your target, such as IC in a host, the others also lose their marks.</description>

					<quality name="Technomancer">
						<description>Technomancers are metahumans with the mysterious (if not mystical) ability to connect to and manipulate the Matrix without the aid of technology. They not only have this seemingly supernatural aptitude, but they have the ability to do things that no computer can do or should be able to do. Scientists and magical researchers haven't figured out what makes a technomancer tick, but they agree that it isn't science or magic. As you'd suspect, this makes a lot of people very nervous around technomancers. The fact that a lot of people believe that it might be fun for researchers to cut open a technomancer's brain to see how it works tends to make technomancers nervous around other people, especially megacorporate Matrix engineers.

Technomancers live in a world filled with the ebb and flow of data. They feel datastreams and empathize with icons. The Matrix is just part of the world they live in, as natural for them as walking is for mundane folks. Even technomancers don't really know how they do it - they just do it.

With their intuitive grasp of computers and the Matrix, almost all technomancers are wiz programmers. Most employers won't hire them, though, because the world just doesn't trust technomancers. In the public view, technomancers are creepy and unnatural. They communicate through the Matrix (subverting it, they say) with a thought, so suspicions of a global conspiracy abound. Whenever something goes wrong in the Matrix, especially if there are fatalities, the specter of the technomancer menace rises again in the media and news outlets. GOD can't track technomancers as cheaply as they can track deckers, and so they give little leeway or mercy in cases where a technomancer is involved. There is still a bounty on technomancers in some territories, and technomancy is punishable by death in a handful of places around the world. The end result of this is that technomancers hide their abilities and identities, and some even their talent with programming, to avoid harassment and threats.

This is not to say that all technomancers are bad or out to twist the Matrix to their own ends. Most just want to live their lives in peace. Very few are actually hackers, and only a few of those are talented enough to be shadowrunners.</description>

					<quality name="Allergy, Common (Moderate): Wasps" rank="2">
						<description>A character with the Allergy quality is allergic to a substance or condition found in their environment. The value of this quality depends on two factors. The first is whether the substance or condition is Uncommon (2 Karma) or Common (7 Karma). Next, determine the severity of the symptoms: Mild (3 Karma), Moderate (8 Karma), Severe (13 Karma), or Extreme (18 Karma). Add the appropriate point values together to find the final value. For example, the value of an Uncommon Moderate Allergy (Silver) is 10 Karma (2+8 Karma). If a character is attacked with a substance to which they are allergic, they lose 1 die from their Resistance Test for each stage of severity of the Allergy (e.g., 1 die for a Mild allergy, 2 dice for a Moderate allergy, etc.).

Condition (Value): Description
Uncommon (2): The substance or condition is rare for the local environment. Examples: silver, gold, antibiotics, grass.
Common (7): The substance or condition is prevalent in the local environment. Examples: sunlight, seafood, bees, pollen, pollutants, Wi-Fi sensitivity, soy, wheat.
Mild (3): Symptoms are discomfiting and distracting. Apply a -2 dice pool modifier to the character's Physical Tests while under the effects of the Allergy.
Moderate (8): Contact with the allergen produces intense pain. Apply a -4 dice pool modifier to all Physical Tests made while a character experiences the symptoms.
Severe (13): Contact with the allergen results in extreme pain and actual physical damage. Apply a -4 dice pool modifier to all tests made while a character experiences symptoms. The character also suffers 1 box of Physical Damage (unresisted) for every 1 minute they are exposed to the allergen.
Extreme (18) A character at this level, when exposed to the allergen, goes into full anaphylactic shock. The character receives a -6 dice pool modifier for anything they do. The character is considered to be in excruciating agony. The character suffers 1 box of Physical Damage (unresisted) for every 30 seconds they are exposed to the allergen. First Aid, Medicine, or magical means can stop the damage taken from the anaphylactic shock.</description>

					<quality name="Dry Addict (Moderate): BTLs" rank="2">
						<description>Can be taken at character creation or substituted for the Addiction Quality (p. 77, SR5) after the user has met the requirements for buying off an Addiction (see Withdrawal and Staying Clean, p. 415, SR5). The addiction still exists, but the character no longer suffers the penalties from being without the particular substance.

Any situations that make the fix available require a Composure Test with a threshold based on the stress the character is currently under, starting at 1 for passive situations (offer of a social drink) to 5 for high-stress situations (before, during, or right after a major life-threatening situation.) Based on the level of the quality (see below), players receive a 1, 2, 3, or 4 dice pool penalty on any Addiction Tests following the use of the substance they used to abuse to see if they relapse into full addiction again. If they do, this quality disappears and is replaced by the Addiction quality, but the player does not receive any Karma bonus for the change.

The Dry Addict quality includes the following levels, just like addiction: Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Burnout level. The Karma bonus is equal to half that of their respective Addiction levels, rounded up, meaning 2 for Mild, 5 for Moderate, 10 for Severe, and 13 for Burnout.

Players must select the level for this quality that is the same as their former Addiction quality.</description>

					<quality name="Phobia, Uncommon (Mild): Wasps" rank="1">
						<description>Fear is the mind-killer. It can also cause reactions from distraction to utter panic. A character with this quality has a visceral fear of some kind that shakes them whenever they are exposed. The severity of the fear determines their reaction to it and any modifiers they may face in its presence. That, combined with how frequently they may be exposed to their object of apprehension, determines the Karma value of the quality based on the Phobia table.

Mild phobias cause a -1 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source. Moderate phobias cause a -3 dice pool modifier to all actions while in the presence of their source, and the character must succeed on a Composure (2) Test or feel a strong need to get away from the source of their fear. A Severe phobia causes the character to face a -6 dice pool modifier, requires a Composure (5) Test to stay in its presence, and if the Composure Test is failed the character must move away for at least (5 - hits) Combat Turns.

Condition (Karma): Description
Uncommon (2): The triggering condition is relatively rare, such as the smell of roses or specific insects.
Common (5): The triggering condition is commonly encountered, such as sunlight, trolls, insects in general, magic, the outdoors, or crowds.

Severity (Karma): Effects
Mild (3): -1 dice pool modifier to all actions
Moderate (5): -3 dice pool modifier to all actions; Composure (2) Test or must get away from the source
Severe (10): -6 dice pool modifier; Composure (5) Test or must flee from the source for (5 - hits) Combat Turns</description>

							<item name="Advanced Safety System" quantity="1" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
								<description>It's always good to make sure your weapon only goes off when you want it to. The advance safety system works along with your smartlink (meaning that you need a smartlink to have one of these) to make sure only an authorized user fires the gun. There are a few ways to pull this off - one is to have biometric scanners in the grip or butt of the weapon, or the system can scan for an authorized RFID tag or PAN within 1 meter of the weapon. (This works similarly to a maglock card reader, system, p. 363, SR5.) If the authorized user(s) is present or holding the gun, it'll be ready to fire. If not, no dice. These systems have a default Device Rating of 3.

The basic system keeps unauthorized users from firing the gun, but you can put on a few extras to make things a little more interesting for people trying to mess with your stuff. The immobilizer locks everything up so that it will take more than a biometric scan to get it going again; instead, you need an Armorer took kit and an Armorer + Logic (12, 5 minutes) Extended Test to get it working again. Self destruct bricks the thing but good, damaging the internals beyond repair. Explosive self destruct is the next step up, blowing the weapon up with 14P(f) damage (AP -5 for the person holding the weapon, +4 for anyone else) and a -2/m blast radius. Electro shocker delivers 5S(e) damage to the miscreant using your weapon; it can go off three times before it needs to be recharged. You can only have one extra deterrent as part of your safety system. The system, whether it's the basic one or a fancier version, can only go in the internal slot.</description>

								<description>This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user's smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a -3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance.

If you're using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun's Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface.

Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon's price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444).</description>

								<description>As if catching a bullet wasn't bad enough, these babies make you worry about getting tracked like a wild animal afterwards.

Tracker rounds include an RFID tag inside the bullet. If the target is damaged by the hit, the tracker round remains within the body of the target until it is removed. If all damage is resisted, the round is imbedded in the target's armor. On a Grazing Hit, roll the attacking character's Edge. A single hit means the tracker imbeds in the armor; no hits means the shooter will be tracking the movements of the nearby pavement.

Tracker rounds contain either security or stealth tags (see p. 440, SR5).</description>

CS gas is an irritant that affects the eyes, skin, and mucus membranes, causing them to burn and water. It also stimulates a physiological panic response: increased heart rate, shortness of breath, and so forth.

Washing thoroughly with soap and water can remove CS from the victim's skin, thus ending the duration of the nausea prematurely. CS gas becomes inert after 2 minutes of contact with the air.</description>

								<description>Have trouble holding on to your gun? Then maybe you shouldn't have one. But if that's not an option, then try gecko grip, which makes your piece stick in your hand like, well, a gecko hanging on a wall. This gives your grip a bunch of tiny fibers that are awfully clingy to just about anything. The fibers can be turned on and off via wireless command if you have a smartgun - if not, pressing two buttons at the same time does the trick. The mod gives a +6 bonus on any tests to see if a character keeps grip on the gun. This can go on any weapon with a grip, whether they have a stock slot or not; if they have a stock slot, this takes it up.</description>

Seeing, for example, only the edge of a cuff poking out from under the sleeve of a battered overcoat or the hem of a dress beneath a housecoat will not provide the modifier).

This is good for fashion, but great for vanishing into a crowd if you need a quick costume change. You can even get armored clothing in electrochromic styles. It takes a Simple Action to change the settings on your electrochromic clothes, but a couple of Combat Turns to complete the change.</description>

						<description>Max Value: 500,000Â¥
Cash for the late 21st century. A certified credstick is not registered to any specific person - the electronic funds encoded on it belong to the holder, requiring no special ID or authorization to use. The bad news is that you can be physically mugged, any money you have on your credstick jacked and rolled. The good news is that certified credsticks are completely untraceable. They're not even wireless - you have to slot them into a universal data connector to transfer cash onto or off of them. This makes them enduringly popular with shadowrunners and the Mr. Johnsons who love to hire them.

Each type of credstick can only hold up to a certain amount of money, listed on the table. This is the maximum amount it can carry, not the amount it always has on it - so don't get excited when you see a gold credstick until you've slotted it and checked its balance.</description>

					<item name="Datachip" quantity="20" size="Human/Elf/Ork Size" wireless="Present">
						<description>These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Datachip: For occasions when you want to transfer data by physical means - like bringing the project specs on the competition's new cyberdeck to Mr. Johnson in person at the meet - a datachip can hold enormous quantitites of data in a small finger-sized chip, accessible by any electronic device. Datachips have no wireless capability, so you need to plug them into a universal data connector (found on any device) if you want to read or write to them.</description>

						<description>Technomancers have a living persona they use in the Matrix. Your living persona's icon can be pretty much anything you like, following the rules for persona icons.

You can change your icon with the Change Icon action, like normal persona users. Since your living persona is just a persona, not a device, you don't have any onboard storage; this is easy enough to deal with because you can store files in nearby devices.

Your living persona's Device Rating is equal to your Resonance. Your Matrix attributes are calculated from your Mental attributes as listed on the Living Persona table. You cannot reconfigure your living persona or run programs, as those are abilities unique to commlinks and cyberdecks. You are not a device, so you cannot be a slave or master, nor can you be part of a PAN or WAN.

As a technomancer, you can only use AR and hot-sim VR (the only way you can use cold-sim VR is by using a cyberdeck or commlink - ew). Since you're in hot-sim naturally, you may add your Resonance to your dice pool for all Addiction Tests for using hot-sim. You use your Mental and Matrix attributes when calculating your Initiative, and your Initiative Dice use the normal rules for AR or hot-sim VR use. Since you're so intimately connected to the Matrix, you get a +2 dice pool bonus to all Matrix Perception Tests.

You don't have a separate Matrix Condition Monitor.

Instead, any boxes of Matrix damage you would take hit you directly as Stun damage.</description>

						<description>Vector: Injection
Speed: 10 minutes
Duration: 4 days
Effect: Alleviates need for sleep
A combination of synthesized hormones and other brain-regulating chemicals, long haul stimulates the brain and keeps the user awake, obviating the need for sleep. A character dosed on long haul can remain awake for four days - without incurring any modifiers from fatigue or weariness. After this time, however, the user immediately passes out and sleeps soundly for 8D6 hours.

If the character is kept awake during this period, he suffers from disorientation (p. 409) as he is afflicted with hallucinations and an inability to concentrate.

If a second dose of long haul is taken after the first has worn off, the character can stay awake an additional 1D6 Ã· 2 days. After that period, he suffers 10 Stun damage (unresisted) and must crash as detailed above.

Long haul cannot keep a character awake past this point, no matter how many additional doses are administered.</description>

On a successful Data Spike action (p. 239, SR5), instead of doing damage, the program generates a negative dice pool modifier equal to two plus the number of marks the user has on his target.

					<item name="Security Tags" quantity="10">
						<description>These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Security Tags: Security-conscious megacorps often implant these security tags in their sararimen and valued citizens, either to monitor employee workplace productivity, grant and deny clearance and security access, or track employees in the case of abduction or extraction (or escape). These same tags are used on incarcerated and paroled criminals, and parents and schools also use them to track students. Security tags cannot be erased with a tag eraser due to EMP hardening. If a tag is implanted under the skin, an Extended Medicine + Logic [Mental] (10, 1 minute) Test is needed to remove it.</description>

						<description>These tiny computers (named after old-fashioned radio frequency identification tags) form an integral part of every product commercially available in the Sixth World. Ranging in size from microscopic to slightly larger than a price tag, RFID tags have a stick-to-anything adhesive backing and can be tricky to spot. Tags are used for geo-tagging locations and objects, leaving a virtual AR message for anyone who comes by, employee tracking, access control, owner-contact information for everything from vehicles to pets, vehicle and weapon registration, and so on. They can also be used as tracking devices, periodically transmitting GPS data to the Matrix.

RFID tags are devices (p. 234) that can hold one or more files, but not much else. The physical location of a tag can be found via the Matrix (Trace Icon, p. 243). Tag data can be erased with a tag eraser (p. 441) or programmed with an Edit File action (p. 239). RFID tags have owners like all other devices, but unlike other devices a tag's owner can be changed to "nobody."

Sensor Tags: A sensor RFID tag can be equipped with a single sensor (sold separately) of up to Rating 2 (Sensors, p. 445). It then records everything it can, to a maximum of 24 hours of time, at which point you can program it to either shut off or overwrite data older than 24 hours. Sensor tags are often used for diagnostic purposes in various devices, including cyberware.</description>

Stealth Tags: A stealth tag always runs silent (p. 235) and has a Sleaze rating equal to its Device Rating. It's disguised to not look like RFID tags, which gives it an additional -2 Concealability modifier. Stealth tags are often used as a backup for security tags by megacorps that are security conscious (and sneaky). They can be implanted the same way security tags can.</description>

					<description>UDLs Asylum is an older pre-fab home out in the sticks of Porter.  The outside is nothing to write home about, with some creeping vines growing around  peeling white vine fences.  Two bug zappers hum and occasionally spark a few feet off of the door.  The door handle was recently replaced with thick metal plating, in addition to brand new hinges.  It might be easier just to kick through the house walls.  Duct tape is used to seal the spidering cracks across the windows, covered from the inside with cleaning supply bulk boxes. 

Inside, however, the place is reasonably clean.  From the freshly scrubbed 40 year old couch (despite it's previous owners rampant neglect), the well-worn-but-vacuumed commercial rug, dented second-hand coffee table has been polished up nicely, and the occaisional loose dog toy for Odin and Sid.  The kitchen area counters are sectioned off into 3D printing, soldering, diagnostics, and assembly stations, with the final on the chain for the microwave and a stacked-on-top coffee pot.  At the floor is two large dog bowls and a large water tray.

One end of the house has a stack of hand-me-down electronics parts, plastic casings, various adapter cables, and networking cables.  It seems to start shaping up into becoming a personal host on the net.

On the opposite end of the home is a non-descript bedroom, mostly taken up by a futon bed and frame, with two large doggy beds, one striped and one a solid green.</description>

					<description>The Ikaruga yakuza was having troubles with their smuggling operations off of I-90 and they suspected the Backstreet Sheldon Boys had something to do with it.  The party of shadowrunners left from the Red Lotus in the Woodlands to scout out the specifics.  When meeting at the local gas station/McDonalds, they ran into the Highway 90 Cobras, a Go Gang of orcs and trolls.  After nervously waiting for them to leave, the Shadowruns discuss their plan. They scope out the neighbourhood and decide to place a security tag on one of their bikes.  The see the bikers interact with a gang, trading chips for drugs, and follow them to see them setting up an ambush - which is another delivery van for the Yakuza.  The driver was killed and a firefight broke out, half of the bikers were killed and half of the smuggled goods were returned back to the Woodlands.</description>

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>

								<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>

							<attribute name="Charisma" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="19" minimum="0" category="Mental">
								<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>

							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Attack" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="19" minimum="1" category="Matrix">
								<description>Your Attack rating reflects the programs and utilities you have running on your deck that inject harmful code into other operating systems, or use brute-force algorithms to break encryptions and protections to lay the virtual smackdown. Attack software is high-risk, high-reward, because firewall protocols tend to treat it harshly, doing damage that could hurt your persona if you blow it. Attack actions are good for making quick break-ins, damaging devices, and dealing with Matrix threats in a very fast but loud way.</description>

								<description>The applications making up your Sleaze attribute mask your Matrix presence, probe the defenses of targets, and subtly alter a target system's code. Sleaze software is delicate, and one mistake will spill the soybeans on you to your target. Sleaze actions are good for intrusions in which you have plenty of time and in dealing with Matrix problems in a slow but quiet way.</description>

							<attribute name="Data Processing" text="8" base="8" modified="8" naturalmaximum="8" augmentedmaximum="24" minimum="1" category="Matrix">

							<attribute name="Resonance" text="6" base="6" modified="6" naturalmaximum="6" augmentedmaximum="19" minimum="0" category="Heritage???Special">
								<description>Similar to Magic for mages and adepts, Resonance is the special attribute for technomancers. Technomancers interface with the Matrix using the power of their mind, and Resonance measures the strength of their ability to interact with and shape that environment (see Technomancers, p. 249). Non-technomancers have a zero rating for Resonance.</description>

							<attribute name="Firewall" text="7" base="7" modified="7" naturalmaximum="7" augmentedmaximum="21" minimum="1" category="Matrix">
								<description>Your Firewall attribute is your protection against outside attacks. It contains code filters, file checkers, virus detection and eradication software, and other defensive programming. Firewall actions are defensive in nature. The most important role of the Firewall is as virtual armor against Matrix damage.</description>

							<attribute name="Essence" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Derived">
								<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

								<description>Edge is the ultimate intangible, that certain something that provides a boost when you need it, that gets you out of a tough spot when the chips are down. It's not used to calculate dice pools; instead, you spend a point of Edge to acquire a certain effect. Every character has at least one point of Edge, more if they want to take more frequent advantage of the boosts it offers. The possible effects of and more details about Edge are on p. 56.</description>

It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.

While denizens of the Sixth World are accustomed to seeing a variety of augmentations and alterations to the metahuman form, the "uncanny valley" still exists. The uncanny valley is the disconcerting effect that happens when people see something that is almost, but not quite, metahuman. An animated cartoon with exaggerated features looks fine to metahuman eyes, but a computer program that closely, but not exactly, replicates human appearance is a troubling and unpleasant sight to most viewers. This is what happens when people see others with augmentations - on some level, people notice there is something less (or more) human about that, and they respond to it negatively. The change may not be exactly visible, but it is in some way noticeable - in one way or another, a person has become less human, and on some level other people notice this. This is why a character's Essence is included in the calculation of their Social limit.</description>

							<attribute name="Body" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Physical">
								<description>Body measures your physical health and resiliency.

It affects how much damage you can take and stay on your feet, how well you resist damage coming your way, your ability to recover from poisons and diseases, and things of that nature.</description>
								<traitcost bp="0"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Agility" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Physical">
								<description>Agility measures things like hand-eye coordination, flexibility, nimbleness, and balance. Agility is the most important attribute when it comes to scoring hits during combat, as you need to be coordinated to land your blows, whether you're swinging a sword or carefully aiming a rifle. It also is critical in non-combat situations, such as sneaking quietly past security guards or smoothly lifting a keycard from its secured position.</description>
								<traitcost bp="0"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Reaction" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Physical">
								<description>Reaction is about reflexes, awareness, and your character's ability to respond to events happening around them. Reaction plays an important role in deciding how soon characters act in combat and how skilled they are in avoiding attacks from others. It also helps you make that quick turn down a narrow alley on your cycle to avoid the howling gangers on your tail</description>
								<traitcost bp="0"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Strength" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Physical">
								<description>Strength is an indicator of, well, how strong your character is. The higher your strength, the more damage you'll do when you're raining blows down on an opponent, and the more you'll be able to move or carry when there's stuff that needs to be moved. Or carried.

Strength is also important with athletic tasks such as climbing, running, and swimming.</description>
								<traitcost bp="0"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Willpower" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Mental">
								<description>Willpower is your character's desire to push through adversity, to resist the weariness of spellcasting, and to stay upright after being nailed in the head with a sap.

Whether you're testing yourself against a toxic wilderness or a pack of leather-clad orks with crowbars, Willpower will help you make it through.</description>
								<traitcost bp="0"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Logic" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Mental">
								<description>The Logic attribute measures the cold, calculating power of your rational mind. Whether you are attempting to repair complicated machinery or patch up an injured teammate, Logic helps you get things right. Logic is also the attribute hermetic mages use to resist Drain from the spells they rain down on their hapless foes.

Deckers also find Logic extremely useful, as it helps them develop the attacks and counterattacks that are part of their online battles.</description>
								<traitcost bp="0"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Intuition" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Mental">
								<description>Intuition is the voice of your gut, the instinct that tells you things before your logical brain can figure them out. Intuition helps you anticipate ambushes, notice that something is amiss or out of place, and stay on the trail of someone you're pursuing.</description>
								<traitcost bp="0"/>
							</attribute>
							<attribute name="Charisma" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Mental">
								<description>Charisma is your force of personality, the persuasiveness and charm you can call on to get people to do what you want without having to go to the trouble of pulling a gun on them. It's not entirely about your appearance, but it's also not entirely not about your appearance. What it's mostly about is how you use what you have - your voice, your face, your words, and all the tools at your disposal - to charm and/or intimidate the people you encounter. Additionally, Charisma is an important attribute for shamanic mages, as it helps them resist the damaging Drain from spells they cast.</description>
								<traitcost bp="0"/>

							<attribute name="Essence" text="0" base="0" modified="0" naturalmaximum="0" augmentedmaximum="0" minimum="0" category="Derived">
								<description>Essence is your metahumanity encapsulated in a number. In Shadowrun, you have ample opportunities to alter your body or push it beyond its normal limits. Such actions often have a cost, and they can result in a loss of a portion of your metahumanity, which means a loss of Essence points. Each character starts with an Essence rating of 6, and it acts as a cap on the amount of alterations you can adopt. When it's gone, it doesn't come back. It also affects the Magic and Resonance attributes, as losses in Essence are reflected by losses in Magic and Resonance.
